      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm one of the only independent artists left in the world that really
        care about their passion. I work as hard as I can to bring the world
        what they need, which of course is my art. If you need any artwork
        commissioned you can pay me a small fee of $250k and I might be able to
        deliver. Shipping is obviously 10% extra cost per country it has to pass
        through.

          <h3>Grid/Flexbox</h3>
          <p>
            For this project I didn't have any need for using grid due to not
            having to constrain elements in more than one dimension. Therefore I
            settled with flexbox to set most of my layout. Whenever the screen
            is smaller than 900px it will allow the elements to wrap instead of
            being horizontally aligned. It will also scale the artworks to use
            more of the screen so they are easier to watch on mobile devices.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>HTML Canvas and SVG</h3>
          <p>
            I started out creating the SVG artwork. By basing all the
            coordinates of the container size I was able to create a scalable
            artwork that will work on large and small devices. This is done by
            re-drawing the artwork whenever the window size changes. As each SVG
            element is created in the HTML I can access it by giving it an ID,
            which makes handling on-click events really simple. As it is SVG it
            will also look pretty good when zoomed in, compared to canvas which
            doesn't scale well when zoomed in due to it being based on pixels.
            <br />
            <br />
            The canvas artwork does not look identical to the SVG artwork. This
            is due to a limitation of canvas which doesn't let it use border
            radius for rectangles. This could be bypassed by creating a custom
            shape, but as I wanted both artworks to use the same base shapes for
            all the elements this wasn't possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>jQuery</h3>
          <p>
            As I do have some previous experience with jQuery, it wasn't that
            hard to use it again several years later. I've used jQuery for most
            of my code, but I did have some functionality that wasn't that well
            supported by jQuery where I used vanilla JavaScript instead. I find
            that jQuery is really useful for creating websites such as this, as
            it does shorten the code a lot, especially when referencing several
            elements by their ID.
            <br />
            <br />
            My code did not have to be as long as it is, but as I wanted to make
            sure that both the artworks were responsive I decided to put some
            extra effort into the code to make sure that they would both scale
            appropriately to different screen sizes.
          </p>

          <h3>Cross-browser testing</h3>
          <p>
            When testing for different browsers I decided to go with Google
            Chrome which is my main browser which I developed this project in,
            and also the new Microsoft Edge to test how well their new browser
            works with the functionality I've implemented. They do look and
            behave identically on both browsers for all screen sizes and
            resolutions.
